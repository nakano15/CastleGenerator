The idea of this castle generator mod, is to try creating procedurally generated castles, and fill them with 
treasures and monsters you have to face. The idea is offering a different adventure everytime the player enters 
a new castle, being that you can even start your gameplay on one with a new character.

This mod is inspired by Castlevania games, and also randomizer mods for Castlevania Games on DS. I made the scripts of the 
coding by wondering how the random castle generation would work.

By the moment I wrote this readme file, the mod was still wip, so I don't recommend trying it until I get a working version of 
it, since I need to populate the mod with things you can play with, before you can even have access to it.
If you're a modder and want to check the mod, feel free to, just don't be a filthy thief. I spent time developing this mod, 
and also got headbonks from people on discord for developing this when I should be taking it easy of modding.
